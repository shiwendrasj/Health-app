# 🛡️ SehatPal - One Tap to Safety

**SehatPal** is a dual-mode healthcare ecosystem designed to bridge the gap between daily health management and critical emergency response. Our mission is to reduce "Golden Hour" losses through accessible, empowering innovation.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🚨 Emergency Mode (Golden Hour Response)
* **QR-Based Access:** Instant access to critical medical history via a secure QR code during a crisis.
* **Life-Saving Essentials:** Displays only critical information like Blood Group, Allergies, and Current Medications to speed up medical decision-making.
* **Offline Ready:** Uses static QR text for immediate info even with poor connectivity.

### ⚕️ OPD Mode (Unified Healthcare Hub)
* **Centralized Records:** Store prescriptions, lab reports, and medical documents in one secure location.
* **Smart Booking:** Real-time doctor availability and one-tap appointment scheduling.
* **Medication Tracking:** Manage dosages and daily reminders for active prescriptions.

## 📂 Project Structure
Organized using a professional directory structure for scalability and clarity:

* `index.html` & `login.html`: Entry points for the application.
* `css/`: Contains `styles.css` for a modern healthcare UI.
* `js/`: Contains `script.js` for data persistence and core logic.
* `pages/`: Internal modules for dashboards, scanning, and records.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Inter Font, Custom UI components).
* **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic rendering and application state.
* **Data Persistence:** Utilizes browser `localStorage` to simulate a database for patient data and records.
